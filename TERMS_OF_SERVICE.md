## 1. Description of the Service

SafeBite provides the following functionalities:

- **Ingredient Scanning:** Uses on-device optical character recognition (OCR) via Google ML Kit to read food product labels from photographs.
- **Dietary Compatibility Analysis:** Compares detected ingredients against your configured dietary restrictions (allergies, intolerances, ethical or religious preferences) using a local database.
- **AI-Powered Validation (Optional):** Uses Google Gemini AI to validate or enhance ingredient detection when the user explicitly requests it.
- **Barcode Scanning:** Looks up product information via the Open Food Facts public database.
- **Scan History, Statistics, Export, and Product Comparison:** Tools to manage and analyze your scanning data.
- **Cloud Sync (Optional):** Synchronizes your data across devices when you sign in with a Google account or email/password through Firebase Authentication.

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) to use SafeBite. By using the App, you represent that you meet this requirement. If you are under 18, you must have parental or guardian consent to use the App and make purchases.

## 3. Account Registration

Creating an account is **optional**. SafeBite works fully without an account in offline mode. If you choose to create an account (via Google Sign-In or email/password), you are responsible for:

- Providing accurate information.
- Maintaining the security of your login credentials.
- All activities that occur under your account.

You may delete your account and all associated cloud data at any time from within the App's settings.

## 4. Subscriptions and Payments

### 4.1 Free Tier ("SafeBite Basic")

SafeBite offers a free tier with limited daily usage (e.g., a limited number of OCR scans and barcode lookups per day). The free tier does not include access to AI validation, advanced statistics, product comparison, data export, or cloud sync.

### 4.2 Premium Tier ("SafeBite Pro")

SafeBite Pro unlocks all features, including unlimited scans, AI-powered validation, product comparison, statistics, data export, and cloud sync. SafeBite Pro is available through the following plans:

- **Monthly Subscription:** Billed monthly at the price displayed in the App.
- **Annual Subscription:** Billed annually at the price displayed in the App.
- **Lifetime Purchase:** A one-time payment granting permanent access to SafeBite Pro.

### 4.3 Free Trial

We may offer a free trial period (e.g., 7 days) for new subscribers. During the trial, you will have full access to SafeBite Pro features. If you do not cancel before the trial ends, your subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription at the applicable plan rate.

### 4.4 Billing and Renewal

- All purchases are processed through **Google Play** (Android) or the **App Store** (iOS), and are subject to the respective store's terms and conditions.
- Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.
- You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your device's app store settings (Google Play Store → Subscriptions or App Store → Subscriptions).
- We use **RevenueCat** as our subscription management platform. RevenueCat processes subscription events on our behalf but does not independently collect personal information beyond what is necessary for purchase management.

### 4.5 Refunds

Refund requests are handled by the respective app store (Google Play or App Store) in accordance with their refund policies. We do not process refunds directly.

### 4.6 Price Changes

We reserve the right to change subscription prices. Existing subscribers will be notified in advance, and any price change will apply only to future billing cycles, not to the current active period.
